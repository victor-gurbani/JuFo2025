## Technical Documentation

### System Overview
The School Access Control System is designed to streamline student entry/exit permissions using secure card-based authentication. The system integrates with existing school infrastructure and Phidias, utilizing pre-existing student photos and data while maintaining strict data protection standards.

### Core Components

#### 1. Physical Infrastructure
- NFC/RFID Card Reader at school entrance
- Display screen for security personnel
- iPad-based teacher interface
- Secure cards with unique UIDs (Madrid Metro compatible technology)

#### 2. Software Components
- Teacher Permission Management Interface
- Access Control System
- Security Verification Interface
- Logging and Monitoring System

### User Roles and Permissions

#### Class Tutors
- Assign cards to their assigned students
- Set permission schedules (one-time and recurring)
- View and modify permissions for their students
- Invalidate lost/stolen cards
- View access logs for their students

#### Regular Teachers
- View student permission schedules
- View current permissions for their class attendees

#### Security Personnel
- View student photos and permission details via display screen

### Core Processes

#### Card Assignment Process
1. Tutor receives parent confirmation for student access
2. Tutor selects available card from physical storage
3. Tutor logs into iPad application
4. Tutor enters card UID and selects student
5. Tutor sets permission parameters:
   - Start date/time
